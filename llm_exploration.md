# LLM Exploration for Fraud Detection and Policy Suggestion

## Open-Source LLM Options

*   **Hugging Face Transformers:** A library providing access to a wide range of pre-trained language models.
    *   **Pros:** Large community, extensive documentation, easy to use.
    *   **Cons:** Requires fine-tuning for specific tasks, can be computationally expensive.
*   **GPT-2/GPT-3 (via API):** OpenAI's language models.
    *   **Pros:** High performance, readily available.
    *   **Cons:** Not open-source, requires API access and payment.
*   **FLAN-T5:** A family of open-source language models from Google.
    *   **Pros:** Good performance, open-source.
    *   **Cons:** Requires fine-tuning for specific tasks.

## RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Frameworks

*   **LangChain:** A framework for building applications powered by language models.
    *   **Pros:** Provides tools for data connection, prompt management, and model integration.
    *   **Cons:** Can be complex to set up and use.
*   **Haystack:** A framework for building search systems powered by language models.
    *   **Pros:** Focuses on search and retrieval, making it suitable for RAG.
    *   **Cons:** Limited to search-related tasks.

## Potential Use Cases

*   **Fraud Detection:**
    *   Analyzing transaction descriptions and user reviews to identify suspicious patterns.
    *   Identifying unusual product combinations or suspicious language.
*   **Policy Suggestion:**
    *   Analyzing transaction data to identify potential fraud patterns.
    *   Suggesting new fraud detection policies based on the identified patterns.
*   **Risk and Compliance Analysis:**
    *   Analyzing existing policies (UU PDP, ISO standards, fraud rules) to identify potential risks and compliance issues.

## Next Steps

1.  Experiment with different open-source LLMs (e.g., FLAN-T5) and RAG frameworks (e.g., LangChain) to evaluate their performance on fraud detection and policy suggestion tasks.
2.  Fine-tune the selected LLM on a dataset of fraudulent transactions and fraud detection policies.
3.  Integrate the LLM with the Policy Engine to automatically suggest new fraud detection policies.
